# Changelog

## 0.1.1 - 2026-09-11

- Keep settings namespace branding type-only so dsh host helper-export changes cannot prevent plugin startup.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-29

- Validate the published bundle against the npm `latest` DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2` release.
- Publish dsh-sag as an installable DeepSeek Harness profile bundle.
- Discover and configure a running local SAG through `setup` and `doctor`.
- Expose search, reading, knowledge-source, upload, ingestion, and document-management tools.
- Store connection metadata and credentials through dsh host services.
- Keep the Python sidecar available as an explicit advanced embedded mode.
